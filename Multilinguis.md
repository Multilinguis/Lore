## Lore
#### Background
* Originally a disembodied Soul that was inside of a powerful Sword that was Crafted by [[Kawataro]].
* Transferred into the corpse of Rufferamin when Genesis killed him with the sword and a piece of it lodged in his body.
* Came to life a few days later in the transformed body of Rufferamin.
* Made an alliance with Rufferamin almost immediately.
* Met newcomer Admin and followed her around curiously.
* Abandoned by Rufferamin when he found out she had watched Admin steal from various people, including him.
* Met with Kawataro, who told her of the fight between Rufferamin and Genesis and pointed out that she had no pulse. She would later forget this encounter.
* Decided to kill Admin to win Rufferamin back.
#### Sword Arc
* Went to Genesis for help in taking down Admin.
* Learned about the Sword and asked to see it. When Genesis obliged, she took it for herself and became blood-thirsty, trying to kill Admin.
* Visited Kawataro and remembered all that they had discussed, including that he had made the sword and trapped souls in there. Kawataro egged her on until she killed him.
* Later that day, she went after Admin, who was defended by Morgan and Genesis. She killed Morgan, then Genesis.
* While pursuing Admin, Multi is stabbed by the Sword, which has a mind of its own.
* Brought back to life by Admin and taken to Here, an island labratory where she can be kept safe.
#### Prison Arc
* Admin studied Multi in the laboratory. During this time, Multi had several terrifying hallucinations.
* Admin allowed Multi to move from the laboratory to the surface of Here once she thought Multi was safe.
* Blew up Here, hallucinating that Admin had done it and then tried to kill her.
* Fled from here, pursued by Admin who tried to get her to calm down.
#### Revenge Arc
* Met Genesis, who she told of Admin's supposed manipulation of her and convinced to help kill Admin.
* On the failure of the machine meant to kill Admin, Multi ran into her base to enact her backup plan. She hesitated, however, inadvertantly saving Admin's life.
* Admin summoned The Entity to kill her, but Multi stood in defense of Admin, realizing she didn't want her dead. Admin died anyway.
* Later tried to kill herself to rid the world of the threat she posed, however The Entity made her immortal.
* Burnt by Kawataro's sword, which she had stolen off his body when she killed him.
* Left Kawataro's sword in a chest at spawn, along with her armour which she felt was suffocating her.
#### Immortal Arc (Ongoing)
* Joined Izzy at Spider Lily Village where they started the flower cult.
* Discovered a portal at Almost's base alongside Izzy. The Entity adamantly tried to desuade them from going through it, even breaking the portal. The Entity then gives them one chance to find an item and unlock the portal. Izzy tried two items and is killed for cheating, while Almost used a beacon and was allowed to fall asleep instead.
* Performed a ritual to bring Izzy back to life.
* Realized Kawa had been following them and had a conversation with him about immortality, punishments, and The Entity before being made to turn away from him in anger and thus forget he was there.
* Ran into Trevor and a second portal at spawn. Helped him pass through it.
